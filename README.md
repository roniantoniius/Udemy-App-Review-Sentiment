The proliferation of online learning platforms has led to an overwhelming number of reviews, making it challenging for users to discern the quality of courses on Udemy. Sentiment analysis of these reviews is crucial in helping users make informed decisions, as it provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each course. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate sentiment analysis model that can classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, thereby enabling users to make better-informed decisions. To achieve this, we utilize the 'cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest' model from Hugging Face, which has demonstrated an impressive 94% accuracy on test data. By leveraging this model, we can efficiently analyze the sentiment of Udemy reviews, providing users with a reliable and trustworthy source of information to guide their course selection.
